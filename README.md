My NHL Goal Light based on mcatovic's version
https://github.com/mcatovic/Automated_NHL_Goal_Light

Moved to its own project as the requirements are different and the finished version will be very different from mcatovic's

This is still a work in progress

The 'master' branch is a bit behind but mostly "works" - it crashes a lot due to bad json data from the NHL. It will run ok if it gets good data.  The 'working_branch' and 'develop' are at different points of working and minimal features.
